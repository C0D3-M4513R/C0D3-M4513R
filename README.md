ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m C0D3-M4513R.
My Name is roughly the same across all platorms. My Nickname mostly follows this regex: "C0D3[-_ ]*?M4513R".

 Iâ€™m interested in:
- Programming
- 3D-Modelling
- Animation?

Notes:
- The stats above and languages below don't include commits to any repos in organizations. (as such my java statistic is way lower, than it should be)
