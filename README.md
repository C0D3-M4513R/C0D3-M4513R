👋 Hi, I’m C0D3-M4513R.
My Name is roughly the same across all platorms. My Nickname mostly follows this regex: "C0D3[-_ ]*?M4513R".

 I’m interested in:
- Programming
- 3D-Modelling
- Animation?

Notes:
- The languages above don't include commits to any repos in organizations. (as such my java statistic is way lower, than it should be)

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something? Not sure. 
Do contact me though, if you really want to contribute to one of my projects!
Help is always appreciated.
